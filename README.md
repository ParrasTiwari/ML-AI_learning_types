# learning_types
This repo explains various types of learning startegies. The discussion considers an example of NER task for clinical trial dataset.
## Task details
We have provided you with three datasets (G1, G2, G3) with minimum overlap between them. These three datasets will define three different NER tasks T1, T2, and T3, with the same set of labels but different entities. Concretely, in task T1 the NER should recognize the entities in dataset G1, assigning each a label from {Treatment,Chronic Disease, Cancer, Allergy, Other}. In task T2, the NER should recognize the entities in G2, assigning each a label from the aforementioned set, and so on.
